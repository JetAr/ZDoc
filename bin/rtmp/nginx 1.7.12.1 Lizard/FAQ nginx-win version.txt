FAQ, 19 March 2015

1. Q: How do the version number and name come together?
   A: The version number follows nginx release version numbers + a subversion number specific to
      these Windows releases + a random theme name based on Alice in Wonderland

2. Q: Why did you not compile in all c++ dependencies? (vcredist)
   A: These dependencies are not always the same between Windows versions, with the current native
      build it will run on any supported Windows OS

3. Q: Are the sources available?
   A: Not yet, there is still no time table when the sources will be released, I am not finished
      yet with this project, when it's time it will go to github

4. Q: Isn't using select slow?
   A: No, select is not slow, it's only seems cpu hungry but not in way that hinders high
      performance usage, Linux really suffers with select but not Windows despite the Linux
      slander about this, our select-boost api has solved this issue

5. Q: Is this a long term project?
   A: We will support this project until the cows come home or until we release the sources,
      whichever comes first :)

6. Q: Do you port every change?
   A: No is the short answer, there is a complex evaluation process which determines if a
      change is valid or not, it’s not just nginx code but add-on’s code interactions which needs
      to be evaluated

7. Q: Why can’t I change drives?
   A: You can but you need to write a path like Linux, D:\Path becomes d:/Path

8. Q: Where is the documentation?
   A: See our website FrontPage and the /download/documentation-pdf/ folder where we
      maintain all documentation files
      Take care using any examples which has references to Linux paths

9. Q: What determines changes or addons to be added?
   A: It must be useful, it must be an add-on unless the change is minimal and low 
      impact on the core, it must compile cleanly under Windows, it can’t have external
      dependencies unless it can be linked to a single dll module, it must not use OS exclusive
      functionality. Add-ons are not removed once they are in unless they are bugged
      beyond repair

10. Q: nginx stop/reload on Windows fails with a ‘Access is denied’
    A: Run the nginx service as a user (and jail that user), then create a simple cmd file;
      - runas /savecred /env /user:nginxuser "nginx -s reload"
      - choice /ty,2 /C:ync  (or "sleep 2")
      - runas /savecred /env /user:nginxuser "nginx -s reopen"
      At the first run you need to enter nginxuser's password, after that '/savecred' will take
      care of this

11. Q: XP is no longer supported after april 2014, are you going to stop support nginx/xp?
    A: Are you a lemming? Neither are we, we will keep supporting XP until it’s technically
      impossible. nginx for Windows native build runs on Windows XP SP3 and higher,
      both 32 and 64 bit

12. Q: Sometimes we see a delay with LAN traffic, nginx is not doing anything but the request is stalling
    A: Make sure you have deactivated netbios (smb) from the lan interface(s)

13. Q: Does naxsi work for phpbb?
    A: Yes it does, but you need to add a few white-list lines:
      BasicRule wl:1000 "mz:$URL:/ucp.php|BODY|NAME";
      BasicRule wl:1310 "mz:$URL:/ucp.php|BODY|NAME";
      BasicRule wl:1311 "mz:$URL:/ucp.php|BODY|NAME";

14. Q: What is nginx_basic?
    A: Basically a one on one replacement for the windows nginx version which is made by nginx
      themselves but with all the benefits and work that has gone into its big brother, which you find
      here, without add-ons

15. Q: WSARecv() failed (10054: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host)
      while reading upstream (backend = tomcat, java or similar applications)
    A: apply these settings to the proxy: 
      keepalive_requests 500;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      context: 	http, server, location
      Version 1.1 is recommended for use with keepalive connections

16. Q: Windows Server 2012 message that msvcr100.dll is missing?
    A: In some cases:
      remove manually "C:\Windows\System32\msvcr100.dll" and (Re)install the program 
      vcredist_x64 from here http://nginx-win.ecsds.eu/
      In other cases:
      Install both the 32-bit C++ Runtime and the 64-bit version as well

17. Q: Is this version production ready? And who is using it in production?
    A: Yes it is! And has been for a while, we are using it in a production environment and
      we are aware there are quite a few others running our builds

18. Q: Did the FD table size increase or am I seeing things?
    A: It has increased twofold following an internal Beta and a request to allow more 
      sustained power with a single worker

19. Q: Do I need the openssl files?
    A: No! what you have seen is an openssl archive on the download site which has 
      nothing to do with nginx for Windows, there is no need to download or use it

20. Q: Do I need lua51.dll?
    A: With nginx.exe you do need it, nginx_basic.exe does not need this library

21. Q: What do I do when people say "don’t run nginx under Windows" and "it’s not designed
      for Windows" ?
    A: It depends on your mood, we suggest you reply with "maybe it is time you get your head
      unstuck from your ignorant behind", but hey, it is only a suggestion

22. Q: Can I use other DLL functions with Lua and import them?
    A: Yes but they need to be compiled against http://luajit.org/download.html (at the
      moment v2.0.3), use 'findstr "LuaJIT " lua51.dll' to see which version we have shipped,
      functions can be used for example: 'local functionname = package.loadlib("External.dll",
      "luaopen_Function");' See also these examples http://www.scilua.org/ljsqlite3.html

      See the download section

23. Q: Consistent with original nginx code (subject to Windows compatibility)?
    A: This has been coming for a while, original nginx code which is absolutely not compatible
      with Windows, we’ve been re-engineering a number of changesets to deal with this and 
      maintain the original code, today (19-3) we have decided to stop re-engineering and have 
      laid out our own roadmap. What exactly this is going to mean for functions and features 
      between nginx Linux and our nginx for Windows is jet unknown
        The roadmap we have setup will focus on;
      - adding more security measures against any possible way of attack (some already done)
      - our todo list
      - getting every possible problem documented and solved (we’re doing this already)
      - more non-blocking out of the box interfaces, for example Java and BI with
        NetWeaver for SAP and Oracle
